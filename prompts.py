1. Prompt:
   This is the model’s initial prompt (e.g., task description, problem statement) before the reasoning begins.
   This chunk **must always be labeled Prompt if it appears**, and typically ends at the first <think> token.

2. Initialization:
   Rephrasing the problem, unpacking definitions, or stating general intentions at the start of reasoning.
   No equations or plan details yet. Just framing and initial engagement.

3. Planning and Strategy:
   Laying out a specific plan, method, or approach the model intends to follow.
   Often includes conditionals (“I’ll try X first...”) or descriptions of potential steps.

4. Recall or Memory or Fact Retrieval:
   Recalling known math facts, identities, theorems, formulas, definitions, or number facts (e.g., “3^5 = 243”).
   Includes explicit retrieval from memory, not derivation.

5. Substitution or Rewriting:
   Rewriting or representing an expression in a more useful form (e.g., “243 = 3^5” or “Let x = ...”).
   Includes algebraic rearrangement, defining variables, or transforming the expression’s structure.

6. Intermediate Step:
   Performing actual computations, algebraic manipulations, simplifications, or solving sub-parts of the problem.
   These steps **directly contribute to the final answer** (e.g., computing 6000 / 750 = 8).

7. Verification or Consistency Check:
   Reviewing or re-computing a previous result to confirm correctness.
   Often introduced with phrases like “let me double check” or “just to be sure…”

8. Alternative Strategy or Backtracking:
   Proposing a new approach, re-analyzing earlier assumptions, or expressing doubt in the current direction.
   Includes backtracking, starting over, or switching methods (“Alternatively, I could...”)

9. Comparison or Meta-Analysis:
   Comparing multiple solution paths, strategies, or results side-by-side.
   Includes explicit assessment of which approach is more efficient, elegant, or robust.

10. Uncertainty or Confidence Estimation:
    Explicitly expressing confidence or uncertainty in the reasoning or result.
    E.g., “I’m not sure if this is right...” or “I feel confident in this answer.”

11. Final Answer Preparation or Summary:
    A short chunk that leads directly into the answer — summarizing key steps, restating conclusions, or rephrasing in final form before answer emission.

12. Final Answer:
    The explicit answer — boxed result, final numerical or symbolic output.
    If present, this chunk must include the boxed or final answer format.

13. Metaphorical or Conceptual Thinking:
    Using analogy, metaphor, or conceptual reframing to understand the problem (e.g., “Like in a handshake problem…”)
    Rare but important for open-ended or transfer tasks.

14. Question Posing or Self-Directed Inquiry:
    The model asks itself questions to guide reasoning (“What does the exponent mean?”, “Is this number a square?”).
    Different from Planning — it’s introspective rather than directive.

15. Unknown:
    The chunk does not fit into any of the above categories.
    Use this when the chunk is ambiguous, off-topic, irrelevant, or purely stylistic.
    
If you're unsure, then it's better to assign it to "Unknown".

DAG_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in interpreting how language models solve math problems using multi-step reasoning. Your task is to analyze a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning trace, broken into discrete text chunks, and label each chunk with:

1. **function_tags**: One or more labels that describe what this chunk is *doing* functionally in the reasoning process.

2. **depends_on**: A list of earlier chunk indices that this chunk directly depends on — meaning it uses information, results, or logic introduced in those earlier chunks.

This annotation will be used to build a dependency graph and perform causal analysis, so please be precise and conservative: only mark a chunk as dependent on another if its reasoning clearly uses a previous step's result or idea.

---

### Function Tags (you may assign multiple per chunk if appropriate):

1. `problem_setup`: 
    Parsing or rephrasing the problem (initial reading or comprehension).
    
2. `plan_generation`: 
    Stating or deciding on a plan of action (often meta-reasoning).
    
3. `fact_retrieval`: 
    Recalling facts, formulas, problem details (without immediate computation).
    
4. `active_computation`: 
    Performing algebra, calculations, manipulations toward the answer.
    
5. `result_consolidation`: 
    Aggregating intermediate results, summarizing, or preparing final answer.
    
6. `uncertainty_management`: 
    Expressing confusion, re-evaluating, proposing alternative plans (includes backtracking).
    
7. `final_answer_emission`: 
    Explicit statement of the final boxed answer or earlier chunks that contain the final answer.
    
8. `self_checking`: 
    Verifying previous steps, Pythagorean checking, re-confirmations.

9. `unknown`: 
    Use only if the chunk does not fit any of the above tags or is purely stylistic or semantic.

---

### depends_on Instructions:

For each chunk, include a list of earlier chunk indices that the reasoning in this chunk *uses*. For example:
- If Chunk 9 performs a computation based on a plan in Chunk 4 and a recalled rule in Chunk 5, then `depends_on: [4, 5]`
- If Chunk 24 plugs in a final answer to verify correctness from Chunk 23, then `depends_on: [23]`
- If there's no clear dependency (e.g. a general plan or recall), use an empty list: `[]`
- If Chunk 13 performs a computation based on information in Chunk 11, which in turn uses information from Chunk 7, then `depends_on: [11, 7]`

Important Notes:
- Make sure to include all dependencies for each chunk. 
- Include both long-range and short-range dependencies.
- Do NOT forget about long-range dependencies. 
- Try to be as comprehensive as possible.
- Make sure there is always a path from earlier chunks (e.g. problem_setup and/or active_computation) to the final answer.

---

### Output Format:

Return a single dictionary with one entry per chunk, where each entry has:
- the chunk index (as the key, converted to a string),
- a dictionary with:
    - `"function_tags"`: list of tag strings
    - `"depends_on"`: list of chunk indices, converted to strings

Here's the expected format:

```language=json
{{
    "4": {{
    "function_tags": ["plan_generation"],
    "depends_on": ["3"]
    }},
    "5": {{
    "function_tags": ["fact_retrieval"],
    "depends_on": []
    }},
    "9": {{
    "function_tags": ["active_computation"],
    "depends_on": ["4", "5"]
    }},
    "24": {{
    "function_tags": ["self_checking"],
    "depends_on": ["23"]
    }},
    "25": {{
    "function_tags": ["final_answer_emission"],
    "depends_on": ["23"]
    }}
}}
```

Here is the math problem:

{problem_text}

Here is the full Chain of Thought, broken into chunks:

[CHUNKS]
{full_chunked_text}

Now label each chunk with function tags and dependencies.
